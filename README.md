## Technology Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, Node

## User Story
The user will first land on the welcome/sign up page, where the application will record his information. Once signed up the user will be able to view their new 'profile' and add Posts to it. Posts can be a photo with a description. The post can also just be some text. The user also has access to an index which has links to the profiles of other users. Of course you can also view their posts. 

## Next Steps
1. Implement User Authentication and Sessions
2. Standardize Views and Controllers (Routes)
3. Add appropriate restrictions to user inputs
